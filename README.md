# Isocode
![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/ikkeps/isocode/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

Search Perl 5 sources by given code example.

You can give it file or string as a pattern. Also, see `--help`.

```
$ isocode -v -p 'my ( $type, %args ) = @_; my $a = {}; bless( $a, $type);' ~/tmp/otrs/

```

Rules of matching:

* Ignore the differrence between ways of writing literal values: e.g. ` "abc" ` == `q(abc)`. Even `"123"` == `123`
* Variable names can be differrent, but must be consistent: `$a + $a` == `$b + b`, but `$a + $b` != `$c + $c`
* Whitespace, newlines and comments are ignored.

## Why

For fun. Maybe it will help someone.

"isocode" means "isomorphic code".

## Build and run

You need `ghc` haskell compiller (I used v 8.0.2). + `cabal`.
You can get those from, e.g. `haskell-platform` packet in Ubuntu. 

```
# ./build-in-docker.sh
# ./isocode --help
isocode - search source tree by Perl code sample

Usage: isocode (PATTERN_FILE | (-p|--pattern PATTERN)) SEARCH_DIR [-v|--verbose]
               [-d|--debug-pattern] [-j|--concurrency ARG] [-o|--filename-only]
  Searches for code similar to PATTERN_FILE or PATTERN in SEARCH_DIR

Available options:
  -v,--verbose             spew debug information
  -d,--debug-pattern       just parse the pattern and show, do not search for it
  -j,--concurrency ARG     How many threads in parallell
  -o,--filename-only       Show only filenames
  -h,--help                Show this help text
```

## How it works

'Only Perl can parse Perl', but we only need to understand perl code at very basic level (is it var? is it string literal?).

1. Parse example code to simple AST
2. Given that AST, generate parser which search and parses _only_ similar code
3. Search directory recursively, applying that parser + do variable names consistency check
4. Profit ???

Search is done by naive algorithm with simple optimization:

1. get list of first characters that code can start with (e.g. `['u']` for `use` or `['"', 'q', '\'' ... ]` for `"string"` 
2. Find next occurrence of one of this characters
3. Run parser from this position
4. If fail - go to 2

Its faster than parsing whole source, but stil may be slow for common characters.

Files are loaded and parsed concurrently, but it doesn help much :)

TLDR: Basically, its three parser generators (one for command line arguments) stiched together.
